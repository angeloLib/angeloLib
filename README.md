# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ã‚ngelo  
Iâ€™m learning how to use GitHub â€” this is part of my 7 Days of GitHub journey!

Iâ€™m a C# developer with 6 years of experience, and Iâ€™m currently deepening my GitHub knowledge â€” not just how to use it technically, but how to really make the most of it. That includes exploring open source, finding fun projects to contribute to, and even keeping an eye out for freelance opportunities.

I'm also exploring new languages like **Solidity** and **Rust** (still deciding!), and I love sharpening my skills on platforms like **Codewars**, where I can tackle challenges and grow through practice.

This journey is about building, learning in public, and connecting with others who love code as much as I do. Letâ€™s build something cool! ðŸš€
